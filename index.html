          <div class="about-body">
            <p>Jonathan began in sport, where pressure is visible and mistakes are immediate. That foundation expanded into research and applied work across exploration, military, healthcare, the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, and leadership environments where performance is measured in real time.</p>
            <p>In every performance environment, one pattern repeats itself. Breakdowns rarely begin with strategy. They begin with misunderstanding. And misunderstanding is almost always the by-product of unclear communication, which in turn grows from weak understanding and poor connection.</p>
            <p>Jonathan developed the Archetype Assessment by distilling the strongest elements from dozens of established personality frameworks into one decisive choice with detailed, practical feedback. It is offered freely because self awareness should not be restricted to those with access or budget. Clarity is the first step. Deliberate practice is the second.</p>
            <p>Currently, Jonathan supports international exploration initiatives, elite sport programmes, healthcare leaders, and high performance organisations, helping teams translate insight into disciplined action under pressure.</p>

            <h3>ABOUT THE WORK</h3>
            <p class="about-lede about-highlight">A focused archetype lens grounded in established research traditions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="about-body">
            <p>This Leadership Archetype assessment is informed by established traditions in personality and role-based psychology. It draws conceptually from the Enneagram framework (Daniels &amp; Price, 2009; Palmer, 1991), and Jungian psychological type theory (Jung, 1921/1971). Its applied development connects to the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (Briggs Myers et al., 1998), Belbin’s team role theory (Belbin, 2010; Aritzeta et al., 2007), DISC behavioural profiling originating in Marston’s work on emotional expression (Marston, 1928), motivational frameworks underpinning the PRINT assessment and Free Trait Theory (Little, 2008, 2014), and strengths-based developmental models such as the Spotlight Assessment (Lencioni, 2016). Broader archetype theory from analytical psychology further informs the conceptual framing (Jung, 1968; Pearson, 1991).</p>
            <p>Each of these systems provides detailed and often psychometrically developed insight into personality, behavioural tendencies, motivation, and team contribution. I have worked with and personally experienced these assessments extensively and recognise both their depth and developmental value. Users who wish to undertake a comprehensive personality or behavioural instrument are encouraged to do so.</p>
            <p>In contrast, this Archetype model represents a proprietary integration of these traditions through my own research and applied leadership work. It offers a streamlined developmental snapshot of your dominant leadership preference at this moment in time. It reflects how you are currently showing up rather than who you are permanently. Unlike trait-based models that imply relative stability, this framework assumes adaptive capacity. Preferences can evolve through deliberate practice, self-awareness, and contextual demand. Leadership is not fixed. It is cultivated.</p>
            <p>This diagnostic is also grounded in contemporary extreme team research, particularly the structural configuration framework identified in a systematic review of 195 studies on high risk teams (Feitosa et al., 2025). That research demonstrated that extreme teams can be understood along three core dimensions:</p>
            <p>Authority differentiation - how decision power is distributed across the team<br>Skill differentiation - how specialised roles and expertise are structured<br>Temporal stability - how stable membership and relational patterns remain over time</p>
            <p>The integration of personality preference and structural configuration provides a dual lens. One clarifies how you tend to lead. The other clarifies how teams organise under sustained pressure. Together they move beyond labels and into operational understanding.</p>
